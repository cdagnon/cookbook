This webapp lets users organize recipes.
You must register and then log in to be able to add recipes or list the cooks,
but anyone can list or search recipes.

See /test/selenium/ for all verified user functionality.

NOTE
When I ran 'bundle install' 20110928W 00:30CT, and gem dependencies made it fail:
----
C:\tmp\cdagnon-cookbook-41c2955>bundle
Fetching source index for http://rubygems.org/
Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "rack-test":
  In Gemfile:
    rails (= 3.0.1) depends on
      rack-test (~> 0.5.4)

    cucumber-rails (= 0.4.0) depends on
      rack-test (0.6.1)
----
But during my initial install 7 days ago and now, 6.5 hours later, it runs fine (eg. no local modifications).
